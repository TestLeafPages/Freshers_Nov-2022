             Java

Java is object oriented programming language

Why Java
1.Java is high level programming language
2.High Security
3.Platform Independent
4.Java is open source
Purpose of Java
1.Java is used for developing all types of cross platform application
2.Java used for Mobile App developing
3.Desktop
4.Web
5.Server Side
6.Dynamic WebApplication



JDK- Java Development Kit
JRE- Java Runtime Environment
JVM - Java Virtual Machine


All java files should be created under
-----------------------------------
src/main/java  - Dev
src/test/java  - Testing


src/main/resource
src/test/resource
(.xlsx,.json,properties,config)


 Class:
Class is a group of object which have common properties.It's Blueprint or template from which object are created.A java class can contain field,method,variable,constructor and block of code...

syntax for class:

public  class Car{

-------block of code---
                  }
here,
public --Access Modifier
class -- keyword
car -- className

Object:
An instance of a class is called object.
Obkect is a Realtime entity.

Syntax for  Object creation:
Classname objectName=new className (or) Constructor();


Syntax for method:
public void driveCar(){
------------------------
             }
here,
public --Access Modifier
void -- return type
driveCar()-- method Name

While Creating a class What are the naming convention should be followed?
ClassName: PascalNotations, Start with capital,when we have multiple words, the second word init cap

MethodName: Camelcase   Start with lowercase,when we have multiple words, the second word init cap

objectName:Camelcase, Start with lowercase,when we have multiple words, the second word init cap

VariableName:Camelcase,Start with lowercase,when we have multiple words, the second word init cap

Explain main method:

 public static void main(String[] args) {

      }
public -- It is Access modifiers ,it can access from anywhere of the class
static -- static is keyword,  without instace of a class
void --- void is a return type. here does't return anything
main()--- method name
String[] args -- command line Aruguments
